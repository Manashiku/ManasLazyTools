# ManasLazyTools
An ambitous plugin for pmx designed to enable me being lazy.

This tool I created with the goal of making it easier for me to convert original, custom, and game ripped models. 



## Current features: 
- complete intergration of my bone renamer plugin, compatible with old versions of that plugins bone dictionaries.
- new way to interact and reorder bones visually using a tree node system complete with a system to quickly reorder and fix the hierarchy based on parent children relationships
- quickly connect ends of standard bones, designed for the original standard bone layout (one spine), the semi-standard bone layout (2 spines), and the newer bone layouts (3 spines).
- determine the end offset of selected bones.
- automatically determine and fix the rotation of arm bones
- quickly create leg iks.
- quickly create eye bones.
- ability to parse and apply material information straight from an asset studio ripped material json.
- ability to parse and automatically generate information for a shader material fx file from an asset studio ripped material json.

## Planned features: 
- a button for automatically moving the arm bones up or down to make them A pose or T pose.
